@article{Johnsen2008a,
abstract = {The shock-induced collapse of a pre-existing nucleus near a solid surface in the focal region of a lithotripter is investigated. The entire flow field of the collapse of a single gas bubble subjected to a lithotripter pulse is simulated using a high-order accurate shock- and interface-capturing scheme, and the wall pressure is considered as an indication of potential damage. Results from the computations show the same qualitative behavior as that observed in experiments: a re-entrant jet forms in the direction of propagation of the pulse and penetrates the bubble during collapse, ultimately hitting the distal side and generating a water-hammer shock. As a result of the propagation of this wave, wall pressures on the order of 1 GPa may be achieved for bubbles collapsing close to the wall. The wall pressure decreases with initial stand-off distance and pulse width and increases with pulse amplitude. For the stand-off distances considered in the present work, the wall pressure due to bubble collapse is larger than that due to the incoming shockwave; the region over which this holds may extend to ten initial radii. The present results indicate that shock-induced collapse is a mechanism with high potential for damage in shockwave lithotripsy.},

It is also shown that the degree of clumping also affects estimates of mass from modeling the light curves of SN Ib.},

abstract = {The discovery of dark energy by the first generation of high-redshift supernova surveys has generated enormous interest beyond cosmology and has dramatic implications for fundamental physics. Distance measurements using supernova explosions are the most direct probes of the expansion history of the universe, making them extremely useful tools with which to study the cosmic fabric and the properties of gravity at the largest scales. The past decade has seen confirmation of the original results. Type Ia supernovae are among the leading techniques to obtain high-precision measurements of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and, in the near future, its time dependence. The success of these efforts depends on our ability to understand a large number of effects, mostly of an astrophysical nature, that influence the observed flux at Earth. The frontier now lies in understanding whether the observed phenomenon is due to vacuum energy, despite its unnatural density, or some exotic new physics. Future surveys will address the systematic effects with improved calibration procedures and will provide thousands of supernovae for detailed studies.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t In this paper, we propose and numerically investigate a family of locally divergence-free central dis-continuous Galerkin methods for ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The methods are based on the original central discontinuous Galerkin methods (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 45 (2007) 2442–2467) for hyperbolic equations, with the use of approximating functions that are exactly divergence-free inside each mesh element for the magnetic field. This simple strategy is to locally enforce a divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field, and it is known that numerically imposing this con-straint is necessary for numerical stability of MHD simulations. Besides the designed accuracy, numerical experiments also demonstrate improved stability of the proposed methods over the base central discon-tinuous Galerkin methods without any divergence treatment. This work is part of our long-term effort to devise and to understand the divergence-free strategies in MHD simulations within discontinuous Galerkin and central discontinuous Galerkin frameworks.

@article{Miles2009b,
abstract = {Blast-wave-driven instabilities play a rich and varied role in supernovae (SNe) evolution from explosion to remnant, but interpreting their role is difficult due to the enormous complexity of stellar systems. We consider the simpler idealized problem of an interface between two constant-density fluids perturbed from spherical and driven by a central blast wave. Where valid, the existence of unified solutions suggests that general conclusions can be drawn about the likely asymptotic structure of the mixing zone. To this end, we apply buoyancy-drag and bubble merger models that include effects of divergence and compressibility. In general, these effects preclude the true self-similar evolution of classical Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), but can be incorporated into a quasi-self-similar growth model. Loss of memory of initial conditions (ICs) can occur in the model, but requires pre-explosion mode numbers higher than predicted for Type II SNe, suggesting that their late-time structure is influenced by details of the initial perturbations. Where low modes dominate, as in the Type Ia Tycho remnant, they result from initial perturbations rather than generation from smaller scales. Therefore, the structure observed now contains direct information about the explosion process. When large-amplitude modes exist in the ICs, the contribution from the Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability is significant compared to RT. Such RM growth can yield proximity of the forward shock to the growing spikes and structure that strongly resembles that observed in Tycho. Laser-driven laboratory experiments offer a promising avenue for testing model and simulation descriptions of blast-wave-driven instabilities and making connections to their astrophysical counterparts.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the explosive burning of oxygen and silicon. Major emphasis is on nuclear details of how the fuel burns and of the nucleosynthesis that results from the burning. By characterizing the explosions in terms of an e-folding time for the reduction of the density we are able to map the nature of the nucleosynthesis in terms of that time scale and the initial temperature, density, and chemical composition. These results make it possible in the future to infer rather well the results of explosive burning without carrying out the laborious integrations of the differential equations for the abundances, as we have done in this paper.

abstract = {Perturbations on an interface driven by a strong blast wave grow in time due to a combination of Rayleigh-Taylor, Richtmyer-Meshkov, and decompression effects. In this paper, the results from a computational study of such a system under drive conditions to be attainable on the National Ignition Facility [E. M. Campbell, Laser Part. Beams 9, 209 (1991)] are presented. Using the multiphysics, adaptive mesh refinement, higher order Godunov Eulerian hydrocode, Raptor [L. H. Howell and J. A. Greenough, J. Comput. Phys. 184, 53 (2003)], the late nonlinear instability evolution for multiple amplitude and phase realizations of a variety of multimode spectral types is considered. Compressibility effects preclude the emergence of a regime of self-similar instability growth independent of the initial conditions by allowing for memory of the initial conditions to be retained in the mix-width at all times. The loss of transverse spectral information is demonstrated, however, along with the existence of a quasi-self-similar regime over short time intervals. Certain aspects of the initial conditions, including the rms amplitude, are shown to have a strong effect on the time to transition to the quasi-self-similar regime.},

abstract = {We present a compact discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) method for an elliptic model problem. The problem is first cast as a system of first order equations by introducing the gradient of the primal unknown, or flux, as an additional variable. A standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is then applied to the resulting system of equations. The numerical interelement fluxes are such that the equations for the additional variable can be eliminated at the element level, thus resulting in a global system that involves only the original unknown variable. The proposed method is closely related to the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method B. Cockburn and C.-W. Shu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 35 (1998), pp. 2440-2463, but, unlike the LDG method, the sparsity pattern of the CDG method involves only nearest neighbors. Also, unlike the LDG method, the CDG method works without stabilization for an arbitrary orientation of the element interfaces. The computation of the numerical interface fluxes for the CDG method is slightly more involved than for the LDG method, but this additional complication is clearly offset by increased compactness and flexibility. Compared to the BR2 F. Bassi and S. Rebay, J. Comput. Phys., 131 (1997), pp. 267-279 and IP J. Douglas, Jr., and T. Dupont, in Computing Methods in Applied Sciences (Second Internat. Sympos., Versailles, 1975), Lecture Notes in Phys. 58, Springer, Berlin, 1976, pp. 207-216 methods, which are known to be compact, the present method produces fewer nonzero elements in the matrix and is computationally more efficient.},

abstract = {It has become very clear that the evolution of structure during supernovae is centrally dependent on the pre-existing structure in the star. Modeling of the pre-existing structure has advanced significantly, leading to improved understanding and to a physically based assessment of the structure that will be present when a star explodes. It remains an open question whether low-mode asymmetries in the explosion process can produce the observed effects or whether the explosion mechanism somehow produces jets of material. In any event, the workhorse processes that produce structure in an exploding star are blast-wave driven instabilities. Laboratory experiments have explored these blast-wave-driven instabilities and specifically their dependence on initial conditions. Theoretical work has shown that the relative importance of Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh Taylor instabilities varies with the initial conditions and does so in ways that can make sense of a range of astrophysical observations.

abstract = {The early phase of high-speed liquid droplet impact on a rigid wall is characterized by compressibility effects through the creation of a shock wave attached to the contact area periphery. Initially, the area of compressed liquid is assumed to be bounded by the shock envelope, which propagates both laterally and upwardly into the bulk of the liquid. In this paper, an analytical model accounting for the lateral liquid motion in the compressed area is developed and compared to the axisymmetric numerical solution of the inviscid (Euler) flow equations. It is shown that the often employed assumption that the compressed area is separated from the liquid bulk by a single shock wave attached to the contact line breaks down and results in an anomaly. This anomaly emerges prior to the time when the shock wave departs from the contact line, initiating lateral liquid jetting.

@article{Dalziel1999,
abstract = {This paper describes an experimental investigation of mixing due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability between two miscible fluids. Attention is focused on the gravitationally driven instability between a layer of salt water and a layer of fresh water with particular emphasis on the internal structure within the mixing zone. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the same flow are used to give extra insight into the behaviour found in the experiments. The two layers are initially separated by a rigid barrier which is removed at the start of the experiment. The removal process injects vorticity into the flow and creates a small but significant initial disturbance. A novel aspect of the numerical investigation is that the measured velocity field for the start of the experiments has been used to initialize the simulations, achieving substantially improved agreement with experiment when compared with simulations using idealized initial conditions. It is shown that the spatial structure of these initial conditions is more important than their amplitude for the subsequent growth of the mixing region between the two layers. Simple measures of the growth of the instability are shown to be inappropriate due to the spatial structure of the initial conditions which continues to influence the flow throughout its evolution. As a result the mixing zone does not follow the classical quadratic time dependence predicted from similarity considerations. Direct comparison of external measures of the growth show the necessity to capture the gross features of the initial conditions while detailed measures of the internal structure show a rapid loss of memory of the finer details of the initial conditions. Image processing techniques are employed to provide a detailed study of the internal structure and statistics of the concentration field. These measurements demonstrate that, at scales small compared with the confining geometry, the flow rapidly adopts self-similar turbulent behaviour with the influence of the barrier-induced perturbation confined to the larger length scales. Concentration power spectra and the fractal dimension of iso-concentration contours are found to be representative of fully developed turbulence and there is close agreement between the experiments and simulations. Other statistics of the mixing zone show a reasonable level of agreement, the discrepancies mainly being due to experimental noise and the finite resolution of the simulations.},

abstract = {The relative performance of a non-linear FAS multigrid algorithm and all equivalent linear multigrid algorithm for solving two different non-linear problems is investigated. The first case consists of a transient radiation-diffusion problem for which an exact linearization is available, while the second problem involves the solution of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations, where a first-order discrete Jacobian is employed as an approximation to the Jacobian of a second-order accurate discretization. When an exact linearization is employed, the linear and non-linear multigrid methods converge at identical rates, asymptotically, and the linear method is found to he more efficient due to its lower cost per cycle. When an approximate linearization is employed, as in the Navier-Stokes cases, the relative efficiency of the linear approach versus the non-linear approach depends both on the degree to which the linear system approximates the full Jacobian as well as the relative cost of linear versus non-linear multigrid cycles. For cases where convergence is limited by a poor Jacobian approximation. substantial speedup can be obtained using either multigrid method as a preconditioner to a Newton-Krylov method.},

We show that the leading term of the spatial discretization error with piecewise polynomial approximations of degree p is proportional to a Radau polynomial of degree p+1 on each element. We also prove that the local and global discretization errors are O(x2(p+1)) and O(x2p+1) at the downwind point of each element. This strong superconvergence enables us to show that local and global discretization errors converge as O(xp+2) at the remaining roots of Radau polynomial of degree p+1 on each element. Convergence of local and global discretization errors to the Radau polynomial of degree p+1 also holds for smooth solutions as p. These results are used to construct asymptotically correct a posteriori estimates of spatial discretization errors that are effective for linear and nonlinear conservation laws in regions where solutions are smooth.},

abstract = {This paper refers to the work of Moeckel (1952) on the interaction of an oblique shock wave with a shear layer in steady supersonic flow and the work of Chester (1955) and Chisnell (1957) on the propagation of a shock wave down a non-uniform tube. It is shown that their basic results can be obtained by the application of the following simple rule. The relevant equations of motion are first written in characteristic form. Then the rule is to apply the differential relation which must be satisfied by the flow quantities along a characteristic to the flow quantities just behind the shock wave. Together with the shock relations this rule determines the motion of the shock wave. The accuracy of the results for a wide range of problems and for all shock strengths is truly surprising. The results are exactly the same as were found by the authors cited above. The derivation given here is simpler to perfom (although the original methods were by no means involved) and of somewhat wider application, but the main reason for presenting this discussion is to try to throw further light on these remarkable results. In discussing the underlying reasons for this rule, it is convenient to use the propagation in a non-uniform tube as a typical example, but applications to a number of problems are given later. A list of some of these appears at the beginning of the introductory section.},

@article{Johnsen2010,
abstract = {Flows in which shock waves and turbulence are present and interact dynamically occur in a wide range of applications, including inertial confinement fusion, supernovae explosion, and scramjet propulsion. Accurate simulations of such problems are challenging because of the contradictory requirements of numerical methods used to simulate turbulence, which must minimize any numerical dissipation that would otherwise overwhelm the small scales, and shock-capturing schemes, which introduce numerical dissipation to stabilize the solution. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the performance of several numerical methods capable of simultaneously handling turbulence and shock waves. A comprehensive range of high-resolution methods (WENO, hybrid WENO/central difference, artificial diffusivity, adaptive characteristic-based filter, and shock fitting) and suite of test cases (Taylor-Green vortex, Shu-Osher problem, shock-vorticity/entropy wave interaction, Noh problem, compressible isotropic turbulence) relevant to problems with shocks and turbulence are considered. The results indicate that the WENO methods provide sharp shock profiles, but overwhelm the physical dissipation. The hybrid method is minimally dissipative and leads to sharp shocks and well-resolved broadband turbulence, but relies on an appropriate shock sensor. Artificial diffusivity methods in which the artificial bulk viscosity is based on the magnitude of the strain-rate tensor resolve vortical structures well but damp dilatational modes in compressible turbulence; dilatation-based artificial bulk viscosity methods significantly improve this behavior. For well-defined shocks, the shock fitting approach yields good results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper studies an Eulerian diffuse interface model for the simulation of compressible multifluid and two-phase flow problems. We first show how to derive this model from a seven equation, two pressure, two velocity model of Baer-Nunziato type using an asymptotic analysis in the limit of zero relaxation time. We then study the mathematical properties of the system, the structure of the waves, the expression of the Riemann's invariants and the existence of a mathematical entropy. We also describe two different numerical approximation schemes for this system. The first one relies on a linearized Riemann solver while the second uses more heavily the mathematical structure of the system and relies on a linearization of the characteristic relations. Finally, we present some numerical experiments and comparisons with the results obtained by the two pressure, two velocity model as well as some test cases and comparisons with another five equation model recently proposed for interface computations between compressible fluids. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A high-order numerical method is developed for the computation of compressible multiphase flows. The model we use is based on the Baer and Nunziato type systems . [4]. Among all the other available models in the literature, these systems present the advantage to be able to simulate either interface or mixture problems. Nevertheless, they still raise some issues, mainly based on their non-conservative feature. The numerical method we propose is a discontinuous Galerkin type. In this work, the interior side integrals are computed thanks to . [2]. Robustness and high order of accuracy of the method are proved on classical interface problems, but also on suitably derived analytical solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

For systems adequately described by the Euler equations, similarity criteria required for properly scaled experiments are identified. The conditions for the applicability of the Euler equations are formulated, based on the analysis of localization, heat conduction, viscosity, and radiation. Other considerations involved in such a scaling, including its limitations at small spatial scales, are discussed. The results are applied to experiments aimed at simulating three-dimensional hydrodynamics during supernova explosions and hydrodynamic instabilities in young supernova remnants. In addition, hydrodynamic situations with significant radiative effects are discussed.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of stratified shear flow instabilities are performed in two dimensions in the Boussinesq limit. The density variation length scale is chosen to be four times smaller than the velocity variation length scale so that Holmboe or Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable modes are present depending on the choice of the global Richardson number Ri. Three different values of Ri were examined Ri =0.2, 2, 20. The flows for the three examined values are all unstable due to different modes namely: the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode for Ri=0.2, the first Holmboe mode for Ri=2, and the second Holmboe mode for Ri=20 that has been discovered recently and it is the first time that it is examined in the non-linear stage. It is found that the amplitude of the velocity perturbation of the second Holmboe mode at the non-linear stage is smaller but comparable to first Holmboe mode. The increase of the potential energy however due to the second Holmboe modes is greater than that of the first mode. The Kelvin-Helmholtz mode is larger by two orders of magnitude in kinetic energy than the Holmboe modes and about ten times larger in potential energy than the Holmboe modes. The results in this paper suggest that although mixing is suppressed at large Richardson numbers it is not negligible, and turbulent mixing processes in strongly stratified environments can not be excluded.},

abstract = {In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), the possibility of ignition or high energy gain is largely determined by our ability to control the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability growth in the target. The exponentially amplified RT perturbation eigenmodes are formed from all sources of the target and radiation non-uniformity in a process called seeding. This process involves a variety of physical mechanisms that are somewhat similar to the classical Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability (in particular, most of them are active in the absence of acceleration), but differ from it in many ways. In the last decade, radiographic diagnostic techniques have been developed that made direct observations of the RM-type effects in the ICF-relevant conditions possible. New experiments stimulated the advancement of the theory of the RM-type processes. The progress in the experimental and theoretical studies of such phenomena as ablative RM instability, re-shock of the RM-unstable interface, feedout and perturbation development associated with impulsive loading is reviewed.},

Using full 3D numerical simulations, a statistical mechanics bubble-competition model, and a Layzer-type drag-buoyancy model, it is shown that the RT scaling parameters, alpha (B) and alpha (S), are similar in two and three dimensions, but the RM exponents, theta (B) and theta (S) are lower by a factor of 2 in three dimensions. The similarity parameter h(B)/{\textless} lambda {\textgreater} is higher by a factor of 3 in the 3D case compared to the 2D case, in very good agreement with recent Linear Electric Motor (LEM) experiments. A simple drag-buoyancy model, similar to that proposed by Youngs [see J. C. V. Hanson , Laser Part.

Properties such as symmetry, conservation, stability, and the duality relationships and identities between the gradient, curl, and divergence operators are all important. Using the finite volume method, we have derived local, accurate, reliable and efficient difference methods t divergence, gradient, and curl operators are defined using a discrete versions of the divergence theorem and Stokes' theorem. These methods are especially powerful on coarse nonuniform grids and in calculations where the mesh moves to track interfaces or shocks. Numerical examples comparing local second and fourth-order finite volume approximations to conservation laws on very rough grids are used to demonstrate the advantages of the higher order methods.},

@article{Kifonidis2006a,
abstract = {Two-dimensional simulations of strongly anisotropic supernova explosions of a nonrotating 15 Mȯ blue supergiant progenitor are presented, which follow the hydrodynamic evolution from times shortly after shock formation until hours later. It is shown that explosions which around the time of shock revival are dominated by low-order unstable modes (i.e. by a superposition of the l=2 and l=1 modes, in which the former is strongest), are consistent with all major observational features of SN 1987 A, in contrast to models which show high-order mode perturbations only and were published in earlier work. Among other items, the low-mode models exhibit final iron-group velocities of up to ˜ 3300 km s-1, strong mixing at the He/H composition interface, with hydrogen being mixed downward in velocity space to only 500 km s-1, and a final prolate anisotropy of the inner ejecta with a major to minor axis ratio of about 1.6. The success of low-mode explosions with an energy of about 2×1051 erg to reproduce these observed features is based on two effects: the (by 40{\%}) larger initial maximum velocities of metal-rich clumps compared to our high-mode models, and the initial global deformation of the shock. The first effect protects the (fastest) clumps from interacting with the strong reverse shock that forms below the He/H composition interface, by keeping their propagation timescale through the He-core shorter than the reverse shock formation time. This ensures that the outward motion of the clumps remains always subsonic, and that thus their energy dissipation is minimal (in contrast to the supersonic case). The second effect is responsible for the strong inward mixing of hydrogen: the aspherical shock deposits large amounts of vorticity into the He/H interface layer at early times (around t = 100 s). This triggers the growth of a strong Richtmyer-Meshkov instability that results in a global anisotropy of the inner ejecta at late times (i.e. around t = 10 000 s), although the shock itself has long become spherical by then. The simulations suggest a coherent picture, which explains the observational data of SN 1987 A within the framework of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism using a minimal set of assumptions. It is therefore argued that other paradigms, which are based on (more) controversial physics, may not be required to explain this event.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the superconvergence property for the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for solving one-dimensional time dependent linear conservation laws and convection-diffusion equations. We prove superconvergence towards a particular projection of the exact solution when the upwind flux is used for conservation laws and when the alternating flux is used for convection-diffusion equations. The order of superconvergence for both cases is proved to be k+frac32 when piecewise P k polynomials with kgeq1 are used. The proof is valid for arbitrary nonuniform regular meshes and for piecewise P k polynomials with arbitrary kgeq1, improving upon the results in Y. Cheng and C.-W. Shu, J. Comput. Phys., 227 (2008), pp. 9612-9627, Y. Cheng and C.-W.

The results indicate that the turbulence does not follow the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phenomenology. The scaling exponents of the structure functions can be described by a modified She-Leveque model zeta(p) = p/9+1-(1/3)(p/3), corresponding to basic Kolmogorov scaling and sheetlike dissipative structures. In particular, we find zeta(2) approximately 0.7, consistent with the energy spectrum E(k) approximately k(-5/3) as observed in the solar wind, and zeta(3) approximately 1, confirming a recent analytical result.},

abstract = {Photographs by J. E. Mack of the first atomic explosion in New Mexico were measured, and the radius, R, of the luminous globe or 'ball of fire' which spread out from the centre was determined for a large range of values of t, the time measured from the start of the explosion. The relationship predicted in part I, namely, that R[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} would be proportional to t, is surprisingly accurately verified over a range from R=20 to 185 m. The value of R[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}t[IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} so found was used in conjunction with the formulae of part I to estimate the energy E which was generated in the explosion. The amount of this estimate depends on what value is assumed for [IMG]f3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}, the ratio of the specific heats of air. Two estimates are given in terms of the number of tons of the chemical explosive T.N.T. which would release the same energy. The first is probably the more accurate and is 16,800 tons. The second, which is 23,700 tons, probably overestimates the energy, but is included to show the amount of error which might be expected if the effect of radiation were neglected and that of high temperature on the specific heat of air were taken into account. Reasons are given for believing that these two effects neutralize one another. After the explosion a hemispherical volume of very hot gas is left behind and Mack's photographs were used to measure the velocity of rise of the glowing centre of the heated volume. This velocity was found to be 35 m./sec. Until the hot air suffers turbulent mixing with the surrounding cold air it may be expected to rise like a large bubble in water. The radius of the 'equivalent bubble' is calculated and found to be 293 m. The vertical velocity of a bubble of this radius is [IMG]f4.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}(g29300) or 35[IMG]f5.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}7 m./sec. The agreement with the measured value, 35 m./sec., is better than the nature of the measurements permits one to expect.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the Local Discontinuous Galerkin methods for nonlinear, time-dependent convection-diffusion systems. These methods are an extension of the Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin methods for purely hyperbolic systems to convection-diffusion systems and share with those methods their high parallelizability, their high-order formal accuracy, and their easy handling of complicated geometries, for convection dominated problems. It is proven that for scalar equations, the Local Discontinuous Galerkin methods are L(sup 2)-stable in the nonlinear case. Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are k-th order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods. Preliminary numerical examples displaying the performance of the method are shown.},

abstract = {The ability of turbulent flows to effectively mix entrained fluids to a molecular scale is a vital part of the dynamics of such flows, with wide-ranging consequences in nature and engineering. It is a considerable experimental, theoreti- cal, modeling, and computational challenge to capture and represent turbulent mixing which, for high Reynolds number (Re)flows, occurs across a spectrum of scales of considerable span. This consideration alone places high-Re mixing phenomena beyond the reach of direct simulation, especially in high Schmidt number fluids, such aswater, in which species diffusion scales are one and a half orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest flow scales. The discussion below attempts to provide an overview of tur- bulent mixing; the attendant experimental, theoretical, and computational challenges; and suggests possible future directions for progress in this important field.},

abstract = {In this paper, we continue our investigation of the locally divergence-free discontinuous Galerkin method, originally developed for the linear Maxwell equations (J. Comput. Phys. 194 588--610 (2004)), to solve the nonlinear ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The distinctive feature of such method is the use of approximate solutions that are exactly divergence-free inside each element for the magnetic field. As a consequence, this method has a smaller computational cost than the traditional discontinuous Galerkin method with standard piecewise polynomial spaces. We formulate the locally divergence-free discontinuous Galerkin method for the MHD equations and perform extensive one and two-dimensional numerical experiments for both smooth solutions and solutions with discontinuities. Our computational results demonstrate that the locally divergence-free discontinuous Galerkin method, with a reduced cost comparing to the traditional discontinuous Galerkin method, can maintain the same accuracy for smooth solutions and can enhance the numerical stability of the scheme and reduce certain nonphysical features in some of the test cases.},

abstract = {We have recently proposed, in [21], compressible two-phase unconditionally hyperbolic model able to deal with a wide range of applications: interfaces between compressible materials, shock waves in condensed multiphase mixtures, homogeneous two-phase flows (bubbly and droplet flows) and cavitation in liquids. One of the difficulties of the model, as always in this type of physical problems, was the occurrence of non-conservative products. In [21], we have proposed a discretisation technique that was without any ambiguity only in the case of material interfaces, not in the case of shock waves. This model was extended to several space dimensions in [24], In this paper, thanks to a deeper analysis of the model, we propose a class of schemes that are able to converge to the correct solution even when shock waves interact with volume fraction discontinuities. This analysis provides a more accurate estimate of closure terms, but also an accurate resolution method for the conservative fluxes as well as non-conservative terms even for situations involving discontinuous solutions. The accuracy of the model and method is clearly demonstrated on a sequence of difficult test problems. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In contrast, the emission from SN 1993J is dominated by radiation from the interaction of the supernova shock wave with a dense, stellar wind released before the explosion. The dense wind around SN 1987A was displaced by the fast wind from the compact progenitor star, and the interaction of the supernova with dense gas is now being detected at X-ray and radio wavelengths. The expected neutron stars or black holes at the centers of these supernovae are not yet significant power sources.},

The operators are based on the same norms as the corresponding approximations of the first derivative, which makes the construction of stable approximations to general parabolic problems straightforward. The error analysis shows that the second derivative approximation can be closed at the boundaries with an approximation two orders less accurate than the internal scheme, and still preserve the internal accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper deals with a high-order accurate discontinuous finite element method for the numerical solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier-Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.},

abstract = {The interaction of linear waves with normal or oblique shock waves has been studied by Moore [NACA Report No. 1165 (1954)], Ribner [AIAA J. 23 (1984)], and McKenzie and Westphal [Phys. Fluids 11, 2350 (1968)] by writing the fluctuating quantities as normal modes. These different studies have shown that downstream of the shock exists a critical angle of the incident acoustic waves where the reflection coefficient is equal to 1. The purposes of this paper are first to point out that this critical angle may appear as a singularity in the linearized Euler equations, and second to show that this problem can actually be removed if the perturbation is no longer assumed to be a normal mode but has a mathematical form which is strictly deduced from the mathematical nature of the linearized Euler equations. This analysis is then applied to the shock wave oscillations occurring on a wing profile and in a nozzle. Despite many simplifications, good results are obtained in comparison with the available experimental data.},

@article{Dimonte2004,
abstract = {The turbulent {\{}Rayleigh–Taylor{\}} instability is investigated in the limit of strong mode-coupling using a variety of high-resolution, multimode, three dimensional numerical simulations ({\{}NS{\}}). The perturbations are initialized with only short wavelength modes so that the self-similar evolution (i.e., bubble diameter Db∝amplitude hb) occurs solely by the nonlinear coupling (merger) of saturated modes. After an initial transient, it is found that hb ∼ {\{}$\alpha$bAgt2{\}}, where {\{}A=Atwood{\}} number, g=acceleration, and t=time. The {\{}NS{\}} yield Db ∼ hb/3 in agreement with experiment but the simulation value $\alpha$b ∼ 0.025±0.003 is smaller than the experimental value $\alpha$b ∼ 0.057±0.008. By analyzing the dominant bubbles, it is found that the small value of $\alpha$b can be attributed to a density dilution due to fine-scale mixing in our {\{}NS{\}} without interface reconstruction ({\{}IR{\}}) or an equivalent entrainment in our {\{}NS{\}} with {\{}IR{\}}. This may be characteristic of the mode coupling limit studied here and the associated $\alpha$b may represent a lower bound that is insensitive to the initial amplitude. Larger values of $\alpha$b can be obtained in the presence of additional long wavelength perturbations and this may be more characteristic of experiments. Here, the simulation data are also analyzed in terms of bubble dynamics, energy balance and the density fluctuation spectra. {\{}$\backslash$$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Turbulence is the most common state of astrophysical flows. In typical astrophysical fluids, turbulence is accompanied by strong magnetic fields, which has a large impact on the dynamics of the turbulent cascade. Recently, there has been a significant breakthrough on the theory of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. For the first time we have a scaling model that is supported by both observations and numerical simulations. We review recent progress in studies of both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We compare Iroshnikov-Kraichnan and Goldreich-Sridhar models, and discuss scalings of Alfv$\backslash$'en, slow, and fast waves. We also discuss the completely new regime of MHD turbulence that happens below the scale at which hydrodynamic turbulent motions are damped by viscosity. In the case of the partially ionized diffuse interstellar gas the viscosity is due to neutrals and truncates the turbulent cascade at {\$}\backslashsim{\$}parsec scales. We show that below this scale magnetic fluctuations with a shallow spectrum persist and discuss the possibility of a resumption of the MHD cascade after ions and neutrals decouple. We discuss the implications of this new insight into MHD turbulence for cosmic ray transport, grain dynamics, etc., and how to test theoretical predictions against observations.},

@article{Cabot2006,
abstract = {Spontaneous mixing of fluids at unstably stratified interfaces occurs in a wide variety of atmospheric, oceanic, geophysical and astrophysical flows. The Rayleigh–Taylor instability, a process by which fluids seek to reduce their combined potential energy, plays a key role in all types of fusion. Despite decades of investigation, fundamental questions regarding turbulent Rayleigh–Taylor flow persist, namely: does the flow forget its initial conditions, is the flow self-similar, what is the scaling constant, and how does mixing influence the growth rate? Here, we show results from a large direct numerical simulation addressing such questions. The simulated flow reaches a Reynolds number of 32,000, far exceeding that of all previous Rayleigh–Taylor simulations. We find that the scaling constant cannot be found by fitting a curve to the width of the mixing layer (as is common practice) but can be obtained by recourse to the similarity equation for the expansion rate of the turbulent region. Moreover, the ratio of kinetic energy to released potential energy is not constant, but exhibits a weak Reynolds number dependence, which might have profound consequences for flame propagation models in type-Ia supernova simulations.},

@article{Yang1993,
abstract = {Families of two-dimensional, unsteady shock-induced vortical flows are simulated numerically. The flows consist of one or more regions of light gas, surrounded by heavy gas, being overtaken by a normal shock wave. The interaction of the density gradient at each light/heavy interface with the pressure gradient from the shock wave generates vorticity. This causes the light gas regions to roll up into one or more counter-rotating vortex pairs, which stir and mix the light and heavy gases. The mixing is characterized by an asymptotic stretching rate. The effects of shock strength, light/heavy gas density ratio, and geometry on the mixing are investigated. These two-dimensional, unsteady flows are analogous to three-dimensional, steady flows that may be used in SCRAMJET combustors demanding rapid and efficient mixing of fuel and oxidizer. For such applications, 1) the fuel injectors should be elongated in the direction of the shock; 2) multiple smaller injectors are preferable to a single larger injector; 3) injectors should be arranged in groups of closely spaced pairs, rather than uniformly; and 4) multiple shock waves should be utilized, if possible.},

@article{El2012,
abstract = {We study a dispersive counterpart of the classical gas dynamics problem of the interaction of a shock wave with a counter-propagating simple rarefaction wave, often referred to as the shock wave refraction. The refraction of a one-dimensional dispersive shock wave (DSW) due to its head-on collision with the centred rarefaction wave (RW) is considered in the framework of the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (NLS) equation. For the integrable cubic nonlinearity case we present a full asymptotic description of the DSW refraction by constructing appropriate exact solutions of the Whitham modulation equations in Riemann invariants. For the NLS equation with saturable nonlinearity, whose modulation system does not possess Riemann invariants, we take advantage of the recently developed method for the DSW description in non-integrable dispersive systems to obtain main physical parameters of the DSW refraction. The key features of the DSW-RW interaction predicted by our modulation theory analysis are confirmed by direct numerical solutions of the full dispersive problem. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report on the behavior of a single-wavelength Rayleigh-Taylor flow at late times. The calculations were performed in a long square duct (lambda x lambda x 8lambda), using four different numerical simulations. In contradiction with potential flow theories that predict a constant terminal velocity, the single-wavelength Rayleigh-Taylor problem exhibits late-time acceleration. The onset of acceleration occurs as the bubble penetration depth exceeds the diameter of bubbles, and is observed for low and moderate density differences. Based on our simulations, we provide a phenomenological description of the observed acceleration, and ascribe this behavior to the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices on the bubble-spike interface that diminish the friction drag, while the associated induced flow propels the bubbles forward. For large density ratios, the formation of secondary instabilities is suppressed, and the bubbles remain terminal consistent with potential flow models.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in developing numerical algorithms for compressible multifluids. Computations ran into unexpected difficulties due to oscillations generated at material interfaces, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms was needed before these oscillations could be circumvented. This paper reviews some of the recent models and numerical algorithms that have been proposed and points to key ideas that they have in common. Noting the known fact that such oscillations do not arise in single-fluid computations, an extremely simple algorithm is proposed which circumvents the oscillations and amounts to computing two different flux functions across material fronts, to update the different fluids on both sides.},

Compression of the liquid in a zone defined by a shock wave envelope, very high velocity lateral jetting, and expansion waves in the bulk of the medium are the most important mechanisms identified, simulated, and discussed. Comparisons of computationally obtained jetting inception times with analytic results show that agreement improves significantly if the radial motion of liquid in the compressed area is taken into account.

@article{Ruden2002,
abstract = {—S. Chandrasekhar, in his book, Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability (New York: Dover, 1961), derives the stability criteria for a semi-infinite uniform density incompressible inviscid fluid with uniform horizontal velocity supported in a gravitational field by one of higher density and opposite velocity. A transitional layer of inviscid fluid with a density equal to the average of the upper and lower fluids, and a horizontal velocity that varies linearly with depth from that of the upper fluid at the top to that of the lower fluid at the bottom is assumed. This anal-ysis of the Kevin–Helmholtz (K–H) instability may be transformed into a model of the effect of such a velocity sheared boundary layer on the Rayleigh–Taylor (R–T) instability of modes with wave numbers in the direction of the sheared velocity by reversing the sign of the top–bottom density differential. Orthogonal modes are unaffected by the shear in the linear limit and are, therefore, R–T unstable unless an independent mechanism for their stabilization is present, such as a magnetic field orthogonal to the sheared velocity. The combined R–T/K–H stability analysis is, therefore, expected to be most applicable for magnetically accelerated media such as a pinch with an axial velocity sheared outer layer orthogonal to the outer azimuthal magnetic field which drives the implosion. Index Terms—Hydrodynamic instability, Kevin–Helmholtz, Rayleigh–Taylor, sheared flow, pinch.},

@article{Miura2007,
abstract = {Millimeter-sized, spherical silicate grains abundant in chondritic meteorites, which are called as chondrules, are considered to be a strong evidence of the melting event of the dust particles in the protoplanetary disk. One of the most plausible scenarios is that the chondrule precursor dust particles are heated and melt in the high-velocity gas flow (shock-wave heating model). We developed the non-linear, time-dependent, and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation code for analyzing the dynamics of molten droplets exposed to the gas flow. We confirmed that our simulation results showed a good agreement in a linear regime with the linear solution analytically derived by Sekyia et al. [Sekyia, M., Uesugi, M., Nakamoto, T., 2003. Prog. Theor. Phys. 109, 717-728]. We found that the non-linear terms in the hydrodynamical equations neglected by Sekiya et al. [Sekiya, M., Uesugi, M., Nakamoto, T., 2003. Prog. Theor. Phys. 109, 717-728] can cause the cavitation by producing negative pressure in the droplets. We discussed that the fragmentation through the cavitation is a new mechanism to determine the upper limit of chondrule sizes. We also succeeded to reproduce the fragmentation of droplets when the gas ram pressure is stronger than the effect of the surface tension. Finally, we compared the deformation of droplets in the shock-wave heating with the measured data of chondrules and suggested the importance of other effects to deform droplets, for example, the rotation of droplets. We believe that our new code is a very powerful tool to investigate the hydrodynamics of molten droplets in the framework of the shock-wave heating model and has many potentials to be applied to various problems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Welch2009,
abstract = {Efficient resource utilization is critical in the viability of geothermal projects. Novel thermodynamic energy conversion cycles exist that are superior to the traditional organic Rankine cycle. Two new turbines have been developed that enable the economic and efficient implementation of these cycles that maximize the geothermal resource utilization. The turbines, the Euler Turbine and the Variable Phase Turbine, can increase power production by as much as 30-50{\%} from low temperature resources and enhanced geothermal resources when compared to commercially available organic Rankine cycles. The Euler Turbine is a radial outflow turbine originally developed for energy recovery in steam systems. Commercial units of 275 kWe capacity are operating on steam, some with isentropic efficiencies above 80{\%}. The Euler Turbine is also currently being implemented in a 600 kW Kalina cycle in Bruchsal, Germany. The Variable Phase Turbine uses axial impulse turbine technology that is well adapted to the expansion of transcritical or flashing liquid flow. The high isentropic efficiency, typically greater than 80{\%}, enables a liquid heat exchanger cycle1 to be used, avoiding the pinch point limitations of the evaporator in an organic Rankine cycle. Because this cycle can use a significantly lower exit temperature, significantly more energy can be extracted from a given resource. The resulting power advantage of 30-50{\%}, leverages the total development cost of the geothermal project. A 40{\%} increase in power production from a given geothermal resource lowers the total capital cost—including exploration, drilling, and surface plan— by 29{\%}. Results of analytical models for cycles utilizing the Euler Turbine and Variable Phase Turbine will be presented along with geothermal power plant designs for both. Additionally, experimental results of operating the first two-phase closed cycle power system with a Variable Phase Turbine will be presented.},

abstract = {A common origin for the Moon and Earth is required by their identical isotopic composition. However, simulations of the current giant impact hypothesis for Moon formation find that most lunar material originated from the impactor, which should have had a different isotopic signature. Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth's mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.},

abstract = {The laboratory experiments described in the present paper observe the blast-wave-driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability with three-dimensional (3D) initial conditions. About 5 kJ of energy from the Omega laser creates conditions similar to those of the He-H interface during the explosion phase of a supernova. The experimental target is a 150 $\mu$m thick plastic disk followed by a low-density foam. The plastic piece has an embedded, 3D perturbation. The basic structure of the pattern is two orthogonal sine waves where each sine wave has an amplitude of 2.5 $\mu$m and a wavelength of 71 $\mu$m. In some experiments, an additional wavelength is added to explore the interaction of modes. In experiments with 3D initial conditions the spike morphology differs from what has been observed in other Rayleigh-Taylor experiments and simulations. Under certain conditions, experimental radiographs show some mass extending from the interface to the shock front. Current simulations show neither the spike morphology nor the spike penetration observed in the experiments. The amount of mass reaching the shock front is analyzed and potential causes for the spike morphology and the spikes reaching the shock are discussed. One such hypothesis is that these phenomena may be caused by magnetic pressure, generated by an azimuthal magnetic field produced by the plasma dynamics.},

abstract = {Results of flow visualization experiments of an impulsively accelerated plane interface between air and SF6 are reported. The shock tube used for the experiments has a larger test section than in previous experiments. The larger extent of uniform test flow relative to nonuniform boundary-layer flow permits unambiguous interpretation of flow-visualization photographs, and the influence of shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions is no longer dominant. The strong wall vortex observed in previous studies is not ob-served in these experiments. It is found that the thin mem-brane, which forms the initially plane interface, has a sig-nificant influence on the initial growth rate of the interface thickness. However, the measured growth rates after the first reflected shock are independent of membrane configuration and are in good agreement with analytical predictions.},

@article{Drake2004,
abstract = {Results are reported from the first experiments to explore the evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability from intentionally three-dimensional (3D) initial conditions at an embedded, decelerating interface in a high-Reynolds-number flow. The experiments used {\~{}}5 kJ of laser energy to produce a blast wave in polyimide and/or brominated plastic having an initial pressure of {\~{}}50 Mbars. This blast wave shocked and then decelerated the perturbed interface between the first material and lower-density C foam. This caused the formation of a decelerating interface with an Atwood number {\~{}}2/3, producing a long-term positive growth rate for the RT instability. The initial perturbations were a 3D perturbation in an ``egg-crate'' pattern with feature spacings of 71 $\mu$m in two orthogonal directions and peak-to-valley amplitudes of 5 $\mu$m. The resulting RT spikes appear to overtake the shock waves, moving at a large fraction of the predeceleration, ``free-fall'' velocity. This result was unanticipated by prior simulations and models.},

@article{Movahed2013,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t The evolution of high-speed initially laminar multicomponent flows into a turbulent multi-material mixing entity, e.g., in the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability, poses significant challenges for high-fidelity numerical simulations. Although high-order shock-and inter-face-capturing schemes represent such flows well at early times, the excessive numerical dissipation thereby introduced and the resulting computational cost prevent the resolution of small-scale features. Furthermore, unless special care is taken, shock-capturing schemes generate spurious pressure oscillations at material interfaces where the specific heats ratio varies. To remedy these problems, a solution-adaptive high-order central/shock-capturing finite difference scheme is presented for efficient computations of compressible multi-material flows, including turbulence. A new discontinuity sensor discriminates between smooth and discontinuous regions. The appropriate split form of (energy preserving) central schemes is derived for flows of smoothly varying specific heats ratio, such that spurious pressure oscillations are prevented. High-order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are applied only at discontinuities; the standard approach is followed for shocks and contacts, but material discontinuities are treated by interpolating the primitive variables. The hybrid nature of the method allows for efficient and accurate computations of shocks and broadband motions, and is shown to prevent pressure oscillations for varying specific heats ratios. The method is assessed through one-dimensional problems with shocks, sharp interfaces and smooth distributions of specific heats ratio, and the two-dimensional single-mode inviscid and viscous Richtmyer– Meshkov instability with re-shock.},

abstract = {A high-order accurate shock- and interface-capturing scheme is used to simulate the collapse of a gas bubble in water. In order to better understand the damage caused by collapsing bubbles, the dynamics of the shock-induced and Rayleigh collapse of a bubble near a planar rigid surface and in a free field are analysed. Collapse times, bubble displacements, interfacial velocities and surface pressures are quantified as a function of the pressure ratio driving the collapse and of the initial bubble stand-off distance from the wall; these quantities are compared to the available theory and experiments and show good agreement with the data for both the bubble dynamics and the propagation of the shock emitted upon the collapse. Non-spherical collapse involves the formation of a re-entrant jet directed towards the wall or in the direction of propagation of the incoming shock. In shock-induced collapse, very high jet velocities can be achieved, and the finite time for shock propagation through the bubble may be non-negligible compared to the collapse time for the pressure ratios of interest. Several types of shock waves are generated during the collapse, including precursor and water-hammer shocks that arise from the re-entrant jet formation and its impact upon the distal side of the bubble, respectively. The water-hammer shock can generate very high pressures on the wall, far exceeding those from the incident shock. The potential damage to the neighbouring surface is quantified by measuring the wall pressure. The range of stand-off distances and the surface area for which amplification of the incident shock due to bubble collapse occurs is determined.},

abstract = {A bubble merger model is presented for the nonlinear evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability driven by a strong blast wave. Single bubble motion is determined by an extension of previous buoyancy-drag models extended to the blast-wave-driven case, and a simple bubble merger law in the spirit of the Sharp-Wheeler model allows for the generation of larger scales. The blast-wave-driven case differs in several respects from the classical case of incompressible fluids in a uniform gravitational field. Because of material decompression in the rarefaction behind the blast front, the asymptotic bubble velocity and the merger time depend on time as well as the transverse scale and the drive. For planar blast waves, this precludes the emergence of a self-similar regime independent of the initial conditions. With higher-dimensional blast waves, divergence restores the properties necessary for the establishment of the self-similar state, but its establishment requires a very high initial characteristic mode number and a high Mach number for the incident blast wave.},

abstract = {Shock-accelerated material interfaces are potentially unstable to both the Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities. Shear that develops along with these instabilities in turn drives the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. When driven by strong shocks, the evolution and interaction of these instabilities is further complicated by compressibility effects. This paper details a computational study of the formation of jets at strongly driven hydrodynamically unstable interfaces, and the interaction of these jets with one another and with developing spikes and bubbles. This provides a nonlinear spike-spike and spike-bubble interaction mechanism that can have a significant impact on the large-scale characteristics of the mixing layer. These interactions result in sensitivity to the initial perturbation spectrum, including the relative phases of the various modes, that persists long into the nonlinear phase of instability evolution. Implications for instability growth rates, the bubble merger process, and the degree of mix in the layer are described. Results from relevant deceleration RT experiments, performed on OMEGA [J. M. Soures , Phys. Plasmas 5, 2108 (1996)], are shown to demonstrate some of these effects. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Hu2006,
abstract = {In this work, we present a conservative interface method for both multi-fluid and complex boundary problems, in which the standard finite volume scheme on Cartesian grids is modified by considering computational cells being cut by interface. While the discretized governing equations are updated conservatively, the method treats the topological changes naturally by combining interface description and geometric operations with a level set technique. Extensive tests in 1D are carried out, and 2D examples suggest that the present scheme is able to handle multi-fluid and complex (static or moving) boundary problems in a straightforward way with good robustness and accuracy. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Half a century has passed since the foundation of nuclear astrophysics. Since then, this discipline has reached its maturity. Today, nuclear astrophysics constitutes a multidisciplinary crucible of knowledge that combines the achievements in theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry and nuclear physics. New tools and developments have revolutionized our understanding of the origin of the elements: supercomputers have provided astrophysicists with the required computational capabilities to study the evolution of stars in a multidimensional framework; the emergence of high-energy astrophysics with space-borne observatories has opened new windows to observe the Universe, from a novel panchromatic perspective; cosmochemists have isolated tiny pieces of stardust embedded in primitive meteorites, giving clues on the processes operating in stars as well as on the way matter condenses to form solids; and nuclear physicists have measured reactions near stellar energies, through the combined efforts using stable and radioactive-ion beam facilities. This review provides comprehensive insight into the nuclear history of the Universe and related topics: starting from the Big Bang, when the ashes from the primordial explosion were transformed to hydrogen, helium and a few trace elements, to the rich variety of nucleosynthesis mechanisms and sites in the Universe. Particular attention is paid to the hydrostatic processes governing the evolution of low-mass stars, red giants and asymptotic giant-branch stars, as well as to the explosive nucleosynthesis occurring in core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, classical novae, x-ray bursts, superbursts and stellar mergers.},

abstract = {The conditions for validity and the limitations of experiments intended to simulate astrophysical hydrodynamics are discussed, with application to some ongoing experiments. For systems adequately described by the Euler equations, similarity criteria required for properly scaled experiments are identified. The conditions for the applicability of the Euler equations are formulated, based on the analysis of localization, heat conduction, viscosity, and radiation. Other considerations involved in such a scaling, including its limitations at small spatial scales, are discussed. The results are applied to experiments aimed at simulating three-dimensional hydrodynamics during supernova explosions and hydrodynamic instabilities in young supernova remnants. In addition, hydrodynamic situations with significant radiative effects are discussed.},

abstract = {Numerical approximation of the five-equation two-phase flow of Kapila et al. [A.K. Kapila, R. Menikoff, J.B. Bdzil, S.F. Son, D.S. Stewart, Two-phase modeling of deflagration-to-detonation transition in granular materials: reduced equations, Physics of Fluids 13(10) (2001) 3002-3024] is examined. This model has shown excellent capabilities for the numerical resolution of interfaces separating compressible fluids as well as wave propagation in compressible mixtures [A. Murrone, H. Guillard, A five equation reduced model for compressible two phase flow problems, Journal of Computational Physics 202(2) (2005) 664-698; R. Abgrall, V. Perrier, Asymptotic expansion of a multiscale numerical scheme for compressible multiphase flows, SIAM Journal of Multiscale and Modeling and Simulation (5) (2006) 84-115; F. Petitpas, E. Franquet, R. Saurel, O. Le Metayer, A relaxation-projection method for compressible flows. Part II. The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, Journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214-2248]. However, its numerical approximation poses some serious difficulties. Among them, the non-monotonic behavior of the sound speed causes inaccuracies in wave's transmission across interfaces. Moreover, volume fraction variation across acoustic waves results in difficulties for the Riemann problem resolution, and in particular for the derivation of approximate solvers. Volume fraction positivity in the presence of shocks or strong expansion waves is another issue resulting in lack of robustness. To circumvent these difficulties, the pressure equilibrium assumption is relaxed and a pressure non-equilibrium model is developed. It results in a single velocity, non-conservative hyperbolic model with two energy equations involving relaxation terms. It fulfills the equation of state and energy conservation on both sides of interfaces and guarantees correct transmission of shocks across them. This formulation considerably simplifies numerical resolution. Following a strategy developed previously for another flow model [R. Saurel, R. Abgrall, A multiphase Godunov method for multifluid and multiphase flows, Journal of Computational Physics 150 (1999) 425-467], the hyperbolic part is first solved without relaxation terms with a simple, fast and robust algorithm, valid for unstructured meshes. Second, stiff relaxation terms are solved with a Newton method that also guarantees positivity and robustness. The algorithm and model are compared to exact solutions of the Euler equations as well as solutions of the five-equation model under extreme flow conditions, for interface computation and cavitating flows involving dynamics appearance of interfaces. In order to deal with correct dynamic of shock waves propagating through multiphase mixtures, the artificial heat exchange method of Petitpas et al. [F. Petitpas, E. Franquet, R. Saurel, O. Le Metayer, A relaxation-projection method for compressible flows. Part II. The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, Journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214-2248] is adapted to the present formulation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kuranz2009,
abstract = {This paper shows results from experiments diagnosing the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability with two-dimensional initial conditions at an embedded, decelerating interface. Experiments are performed at the Omega Laser and use similar to 5 kJ of energy to create a planar blastwave in a dense, plastic layer that is followed by a lower density foam layer. The single-mode interface has a wavelength of 50 mu m and amplitude of 2.5 mu m. Some targets are supplemented with additional modes. The interface is shocked then decelerated by the foam layer. This initially produces the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability followed and then dominated by Rayleigh-Taylor growth that quickly evolves into the nonlinear regime. The experimental conditions are scaled to be hydrodynamically similar to SN1987A in order to study the instabilities that are believed to occur at the He/H interface during the blast-wave-driven explosion phase of the star. Simulations of the experiment were performed using the FLASH hydrodynamics code.},

@article{Theofanous2011,
abstract = {In this review, we consider and unify all aspects of the dynamics of Newtonian and viscoelastic liquid drops in high-speed gas flows, including shock waves. The path to understanding is opened by novel, laser-induced fluorescence visualizations at spatial resolutions of up to 200 pixels for millimeter and exposure times as low as 5 ns. The central role of the competition between Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities is assessed in the frame of rich aerodynamics, from low subsonic to supersonic, and the multitude of characteristic length scales and timescales at play with varying liquid properties. Acceleration and liquid redistribution (drop deformation) early in the evolution set the stage for this competition, and we insist on an interpretation of the drag coefficient that is physically meaningful. Two principal breakup regimes (patterns of bodily loss of coherence) are identified depending on whether the gas finds its way through the liquid mass, causing gross disintegration, or goes around to induce, through shear, a surface-layer peeling-and-ejection action. Corresponding criticalities are quantified in terms of key physics, consistent with experiments. This covers in a unified fashion all liquids, independent of viscosity and elasticity, and the potential role of direct numerical simulations in supporting further advances is forecast. The resulting particle-size distributions (in a final equilibrium cloud) depend crucially on the pattern of breakup, although in this respect the role of elasticity obtains a special significance in terms of the underlying entangled-polymer-chain dynamics. From a more general perspective, we explain the canonical significance of this fundamental problem and summarize the wide range of its practical relevance, including the recently renewed interest in predicting shock-induced fluidization (or high-speed, atmospheric dissemination) of large masses of liquid agents (so-called weapons of mass destruction).},

abstract = {We develop an efficient spatially high-order, Cartesian-mesh, hybrid, center-difference, limiter methodology for numerical simulations of compressible multicomponent flows with isotropic Mie-Gr??neisen equation of state. Effective switching between center-difference and limiter schemes is achieved by a set of robust tolerance and Lax-entropy based criterion [18]. Oscillations that could result from a mixed stencil scheme are minimized by requiring that the limiter method approaches the center-difference method in smooth regions. To achieve this the limiter is based on a norm of the deviation of WENO reconstruction weights from ideal. Results from a spatially 4th order version of the methodology are presented in one and two dimensions utilizing the California Institute of Technology's VTF (Virtual Test Facility) AMROC [7] software. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Effects of high-Mach numbers and high initial amplitudes on the evolution of the single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov shock-wave induced hydrodynamic instability are studied using theoretical models, experiments, and numerical simulations. Two regimes in which there is a significant deviation from the linear dependence of the initial velocity on the initial perturbation amplitude are defined and characterized. In one, the observed reduction of the initial velocity is primarily due to large initial amplitudes. This effect is accurately modeled by a vorticity deposition model, quantifying both the effect of the initial perturbation amplitude and the exact shape of the interface. In the other, the reduction is dominated by the proximity of the shock wave to the interface. This effect is modeled by a modified incompressible model where the shock wave is mimicked by a moving bounding wall. These results are supplemented with high initial amplitude Mach 1.2 shock-tube experiments, enabling separation of the two effects. It is shown that in most of the previous experiments, the observed reduction is predominantly due to the effect of high initial amplitudes.},

The resulting spikes of dense material, which penetrate the less dense material, develop broadened tips, but the degree of broadening varies substantially across both experiments and simulations. The variable broadening presumably produces variations in the drag experienced by the spike tips as they penetrate the less dense material. The present work has used semianalytic theory to address the question of how the variation in drag might affect the spike penetration, for cases in which the post-shock interface deceleration can be described by a power law in a normalized time variable. It did so by following the evolution of structure on the interface through the initial shock passage, the subsequent small-amplitude phase of Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth, and the later phase in which the spike growth involves the competition of buoyancy and drag. In all phases, the expansion of the system during its evolution was accounted for and was important. The calculated spike length is strongly affected by the drag attributed to spike tip broadening. One finds from such a calculation that it is not unreasonable for narrow spikes to keep up with the shock front of the blast wave. The implication is that the accuracy of prediction of spike penetration and consequent structure by simulations very likely depends on how accurately they treat the broadening of the spike tips and the associated drag. Experimental validation of spike morphology in simulations would be useful.},
