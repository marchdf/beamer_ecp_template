# Beamer template for the ECP project

This template was hacked together using
the [Exascale Computing Project](https://exascaleproject.org)
powerpoint template. Not much has been done to clean the code so
please feel free to contribute improvements.

## Funding

This research was supported by the Exascale Computing Project (ECP),
Project Number: 17-SC-20-SC, a collaborative effort of two DOE
organizations -- the Office of Science and the National Nuclear
Security Administration -- responsible for the planning and
preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem -- including software,
applications, hardware, advanced system engineering, and early testbed
platforms -- to support the nation's exascale computing imperative.
